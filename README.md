# H-Mem: Harnessing synaptic plasticity with Hebbian Memory Networks
This is the code used in the paper "[H-Mem: Harnessing synaptic plasticity with Hebbian Memory
Networks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.180372v1)" for training H-Mem on a single-shot
image association task and on the bAbI question-answering tasks.

## Setup
You need [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to run this code. We tested it on TensorFlow version 2.1.0.
Additional dependencies are listed in [environment.yml](environment.yml). If you use
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), run

```bash
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```

to install the required packages and their dependencies.
